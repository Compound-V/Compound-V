# Using osqueryi

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Introduction</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**osqueryi**</mark>**&#x20;is the osquery interactive console/shell.**&#x20;

In this mode, Os-query is completely standalone, does not communicate with a daemon[^1], and does not need to run as an administrator (although some tables may return fewer results when running as non-administrator).

<mark style="color:orange;">**How It Differs From osqueryd ?**</mark>

* **osqueryi**: Meant for ad-hoc, real-time exploration and testing. Itâ€™s an interactive tool.
* **osqueryd**: A daemon that runs scheduled queries, collects results over time, and integrates with logging systems for continuous monitoring.

#### you can download Os-query from -> [https://osquery.io/](https://osquery.io/)

**Launch osqueryi -> Open a terminal or command prompt and run** `osqueryi` **to start the interactive shell.**
