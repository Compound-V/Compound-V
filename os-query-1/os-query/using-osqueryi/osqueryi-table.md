# Osqueryi Table

## <mark style="color:red;">**Commands for Interacting with Tables**</mark>

*   **List All Tables**

    * Displays all available tables in the current osqueryi session.&#x20;

    ```sql
    .tables
    ```



*   **View Table Schema**

    * Shows the schema (structure) of a specified table. This command provides detailed column information (data types and descriptions) for each table.

    ```sql
    .schema <table_name>
    ```

    *   Example:

        ```sql
        .schema processes
        ```



*   **Search for Tables by Keyword**

    * Allows you to search for tables related to a specific keyword. This is useful when youâ€™re unsure of which table to query.

    ```sql
    .tables <keyword>
    ```

    *   Example:

        ```sql
        .tables network
        ```



*   **Query Table Data**

    * Executes standard SQL queries to extract data from any available table.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
    ```

    *   Example:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM processes;
        ```



*   **Describe Built-In Help**

    * Displays a list of all available commands and their usage.

    ```sql
    .help
    ```



*   **Filter Data**

    * Apply filters using `WHERE` clauses to narrow the data based on specific conditions.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM processes WHERE name LIKE '%nginx%';
    ```



*   **Sort and Limit Results**

    * Use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to sort and restrict the number of query results.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM processes ORDER BY pid LIMIT 10;
    ```



*   **Count Rows in a Table**

    * Get a count of the number of rows in a table (or after applying filters).

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM processes;
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT p.name, ps.local_address, ps.local_port 
    FROM processes p
    JOIN process_open_sockets ps
    ON p.pid = ps.pid
    WHERE ps.local_port = 8080;
    ```



* **Correlating Process, User, and Network Information** &#x20;
  * This query retrieves the process details, associated user, and the open network sockets, providing information about the processes, their users, and the ports they are using.

```sql
SELECT p.pid, p.name, u.username, ps.local_address, ps.local_port
FROM processes p
JOIN users u ON p.uid = u.uid
JOIN process_open_sockets ps ON p.pid = ps.pid;
```

#### **Additional Features**

1. **Joins and Subqueries**\
   osqueryi allows for powerful SQL operations, including joins across multiple tables and subqueries for advanced data retrieval.
2. **Real-Time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**\
   By integrating with file monitoring, osquery can track file modifications in real-time. For instance, `file_events` can be used to track changes to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
3. **Cross-Platform Capabilities**\
   osqueryi is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), so the same queries and tables can be applied across various environments.
4. **System and Network Health Monitoring**\
   With tables like `system_info`, `listening_ports`, `network_interfaces`, and `process_open_sockets`, you can monitor overall system health and network performance.
